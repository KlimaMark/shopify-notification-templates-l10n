## Contribution

Just some basic rules to keep some structure:

### 1. Translation

Basically a generic but semantic translations does the job for the start. Everybody should be able to iterate on that basis. Please stick to basic translations first, fancy stuff once a core translation for language is done.

### 2. Language Folder

Please name your language folder according to the well-know [ISO Language Code](http://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_language_codes.asp) inside the templates name.

For example: de, fr, es …

### 3. Language File

Please name your translated template according to the orginal, add 2 dashes and the language code (capitalized) and if needed some variations like formal and informal. For example:

````
fulfillment-request--DE-du.txt
````

### 4. File Types

`.txt` for text templates and `.html` for the HTML version. In both cases frame the title at the the top of the document with 3 dashes above and below. Front Matter style! For example:

````
---
Title
---
Text 
````
