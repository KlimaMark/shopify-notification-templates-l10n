# Shopify Notification Templates, in your language

Some time ago I translated all the [Shopify notification templates](https://docs.shopify.com/manual/settings/notifications/default-templates) into german so I don’t have to do that again and again on every project. Cool, huh? ;-)

## Available Languages

I’d like to start this repo with the first language:

- German informal (txt | ~~html~~, by [me](https://twitter.com/kay_spiegel))
- German formal (txt | ~~html~~, by [me](https://twitter.com/kay_spiegel))

HTML Templates will follow shortly. Maybe there are a few more translations out there on the web …

## Other Languages & Contribution

Aside from the original templates from [Shopify](https://docs.shopify.com/manual/settings/notifications/default-templates) there is no other language on this repo at the moment :-( I might do the spanish and try the french translation but I’d love you to be part of this tiny repo and contribute

Please read [CONTRIBUTION.md]() for more information on how to contribute.
